# Who are we?
Deis Robotics is a club team at Brandeis University. We're a diverse group of students connected by a common interest in robotics. Right now, we're really active in the exciting sport of Combat Robotics, and we've attended a number of events at Norwalk Havoc Robotics Leage ([NHRL](https://www.nhrl.io/))


## What can you find in this website?
1. **Guides:** A hand-full of tutorials and write-ups, for things like wiring, designing, and manufacturing.
2. **Projects:** Our current robots, with links to each of their wikipedia pages at NHRL. 
3. **Calculations:** A calculator you can copy and use to calculate a variety of parameters for a combat robot.
4. **Wiki:** A link to our team wikipedia page at NHRL.
